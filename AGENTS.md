This repo hosts the public changelog for Pulsify. When Pulsify ships an important, user-facing change, capture it in this changelog.

## Changelog playbook
- Stores user-facing release notes
- Mirrors what users see, so treat every word like public-facing copy
- Leave the `[Unreleased]` section empty; only add dated sections once changes ship
- Group multiple same-day updates under a single date

**Add what users will notice:**
- UI polish or behavior changes
- New features or workflows
- Performance or reliability improvements

**Skip anything internal:**
- Implementation details, infrastructure notes, or tooling chatter
- Security specifics, credentials, or private APIs
- Deep business logic or database changes

**Tone & wording tips:**
- Speak to users directly: "You can now..."
- Lead with outcomes: "Listings refresh faster" beats "Optimized background job"
- Use plain language with a neutral vibe
- Keep entries brief
- Focus on the benefit, not the stack

**Great examples:**
- "Theme switching now follows your system dark or light mode ðŸŒ™"
- "Bulk edit lets you adjust multiple offers in one pass"
- "Dashboard now loads noticeably faster"

**Not-so-great examples:**
- "Refactored authentication middleware"
- "Tweaked cache server settings"
- "Upgraded to the Nebula theme pack"

Review every entry before publishing to confirm it reflects what users actually experience and stays within these guardrails.
